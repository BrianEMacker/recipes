Ingredients:
2 lbs Ground Beef
1 1/2 Tablespoons Fish Sauce (for more daring, savory depth, use 2 tablespoons)
2 cloves Garlic, crushed or fine mince
1 teaspoon Sugar
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground Black Pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, garlic, sugar and black pepper. Add the marinade to the ground beef and combine until all the ingredients are mixed together well. Refrigerate the beef for at least 30 minutes. Marinade overnight in the fridge for optimum flavor.
